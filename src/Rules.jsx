              <strong>1. Rolling the Dice:</strong> Press the "Shake âš¡" button
              to roll the two dice. The numbers on the dice will be randomly
              generated between 1 and 6.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>2. Scoring System:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Doubles Bonus: If both dice show the same number, you win 20
                  points.
                </li>
                <li>
                  High Total Bonus: If the sum of the dice is between 8 and 12
                  (inclusive), you win 5 points.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Try Again: If the sum is outside the 8-12 range and the dice
                  do not show doubles, you lose 5 points.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>3. Game Rounds:</strong> Each roll counts as one round.
              Your round count will increment with every roll.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>4. Winning and Losing:</strong> The game continues
              indefinitely. Keep rolling to accumulate points. Aim to maximize
              your score by rolling doubles and high totals.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5. End of Game:</strong> There is no formal end to the
              game. Play as long as you like and try to beat your high score.
